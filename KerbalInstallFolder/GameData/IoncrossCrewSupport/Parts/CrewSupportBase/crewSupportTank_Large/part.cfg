	description = This anything but small oxygen tank holds enough air to keep a single Kerbal alive for about 600 days.  Combined with the Life Support Electric Algae or Integrated Waste Recycler module, that duration can be extended to longer than any Kerbal would wish to be left in a small capsule for.
