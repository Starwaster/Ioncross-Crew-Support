v1.11
- added proper GetInfo function to generators and crew support module (shows resource usage in part description in editor)
- removed ModuleManager_HOME.cfg (HOME 1.0.5 parts have spaces in their names and are therefore incompatable with ModuleManager)
- updated other ModuleManager files to current versions (as of 2013-09-10)

- moved consumable/waste resource configurations out of plugindata
  - merged ION_SUPPORT_KERBAL_RESOURCE and ION_SUPPORT_POD_RESOURCE entities into ION_SUPPORT_RESOURCE
  - ION_SUPPORT_RESOURCE and ION_POD_GENERATOR entries can now be in any .cfg file in the mod directory
- pod generators now have action groups options in the editors
          
- fixed generators not remebering their active state
- changed generator code to check how much resources and free space is avalable before consuming resources
  - resource consumption will now scale with the most limiting output or required input
- changed generator code to work better at high timewarp when resources are being added and subtracted from by multiple modules
- removed support of requiresAllInputs field from generators
- added effectOnEfficency field to generator resources
  - output levels will be reduced linearly from 1 to 1-effectOnEfficency depending on how much of this resource is avalable from the full requested amount to 0
  - if effectOnEfficency = 1 the resource is required and all inputs will be reduced to acomidate the most limiting required resource
  - if effectOnEfficency < 1 other inputs will not be reduced
  - for outputs effectOnEfficency can only be 1, there must be space for this output, or 0 run the reactor regardless of if there is space for this output
- added hide fields to generators, these turn off the varrious displays, buttons, and action groups associated with the generator
- added outputLevelMin and outputLevelMax fields to generators to bound the output level 
- added alwaysOn field to generators that hides activate/deactive buttons and action groups and keeps the generator always runing
- added startOn field to generators that will make them default to active
  - CO2 scrubbers now start on

- lowered density of oxygen and carbon dioxide from 0.0004 t0 0.00002083 (far more realistic mass / day consumption rates)
- changed efficency of large recycler (LS-32C Life Support Integrated Waste Recycler) from 66% to 60% (3x oxygen multiplier to 2.5x)
  - CO2 rate lowered from 16.67/h to 15/h

  - LS-32C Life Support Integrated Waste Recycler 1250/2500 O2, 0/2500 CO2 to 4800/4800 O2, 0/4800 CO2
- lowered oxygen amounts on cockpits
  - crewCabin 2000 to 1000
  - cupola 100 to 20
  - landerCabinSmall 150 to 30
  - Mark1Cockpit 50 to 10
  - Mark2Cockpit 50 to 10
  - mark3Cockpit 150 to 30
  - Mark1-2Pod 300 to 60
  - mk1pod 100 to 20
  - mk2LanderCabin 300 to 60
  - lowered oxygen amounts on mod parts in ModuleManager files to match

- removed intake part
- added generators to default intakes to convert a small amount of IntakeAir to Oxygen
- added automatic atmosphere vents to crewed parts so they won't consume resources when in an oxgen atmosphere
- added manually controlled atmosphere intakes to recyclers to collect resources in any atmosphere
- added generators to replish oxygen and remove carbon dioxide generators to the launch clamps

- added food, water, and ice resources (food  and water unused, ice for use with Kethane)
- added support for Kethane mining to refill tanks
  - ice can be found on airless bodies using Kethane


v1.10
- included textures done by zzz
- increased oxygen storage on hitchhicker container
- lowered oxygen and carbondioxide density from 0.0005 to 0.0004
- converted structure for kerbal version 0.20
- added overwriten version of the small lander can and cupola pod
- re-wrote code to read from configuration file to allow custom resources
  - consumables and waste are now grouped into ION_SUPPORT_KERBAL_RESOURCE and ION_SUPPORT_POD_RESOURCE
    - kerbal resources take a ratePerKerbal, with the consumption for a part being ratePerKerbal * number of kerbals onboard the part.
    - pod resources take rateBase and ratePerCapacity, with the final consumption for a part being rateBase + ratePerCapacity * part crew capacity
    - both kerbal and pod resources can have effects set for when they run out or fill up
      - boolCauseLock will lock control modules on the part preventing player input
      - boolCauseDeath will use a random number generator to check if each kerbal lives or dies
        - checks are made every killRollInterval with at least one interval needing to pass before the first check
        - each kerbal's chance of being killed on a check is killChance
  - built in waste removal systems are now defined by an ION_SUPPORT_POD_GENERATOR
    - INPUT_RESOURCE and OUTPUT_RESOURCES define what the generator will consume and produce just like a stock generator
  - recyclers are now general purpose generators
    - added ability to adjust the output level of generators in flight
    - added action group options for the generators
  - atmosphere intakes also now can be customized to collect different resources with OUTPUT_RESOURCE_OXYGEN and OUTPUT_RESOURCE_NO_OXYGEN entries in the part.cfg
  - added new resource consumption display module to display the cumulative rate for all Ioncross modules on the part
    - change display to show the average over the last 20 update frames (aprox 2 seconds)
- converted the mod to use ialdabaoth's ModuleManager
- added code to cancel timewarp upon a kill check
- added code to prevent kill checks due to fluctuations at high time warp

v1.03
- re-added crew death on lack of power but changed code to reset timer on power restoration whereas oxygen and carbon dioxide timers only pause
- created custom module for the recyclers
- moved oxygen, carbon dioxide resources to a separate resource file
- fixed a bug with the random number check for crew death on life support failure
- added code for smoother changes in numbers shown on a part's information
- lowered energy use of recycler parts

v1.02
- removed penalty for running out of electrical charge

v1.0
- added oxygen and carbon dioxide resources to ResourcesGeneric
- added IonModuleLifeSupport
  - consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide based on the number of crew in the part
  - removes the crew if the vessel runs out of oxygen or fills up with carbon dioxide
- added IonModuleLifeSupportIntake
  - takes in atmospheric air and consumes electricity
    - oxygen in oxygen atmospheres
    - carbon dioxide in non-oxygen atmospheres

- added three new oxygen tank parts
- added two new carbon dioxide to oxygen generator parts
- added new atmospheric intake part
- added new CO2 scrubber part

- added electrical drain to crewed parts
- added IonLifeSupport module to crewed parts
- added oxygen and carbon dioxide resources to crewed parts
- adjusted electrical resource amount for crewed parts

v1.01
- removed the LS-C02S Life Support CO2 Scrubber since the built in scrubbers do it's job
- fixed an error in the readme where it said "ModuleIonLifeSupport" instead of "IonModuleLifeSupport"
- fixed LS-32C Life Support Integrated Waste Recycler so it consumes 16.7 CO2/h instead of 2.0.
- fixed the recyclers so they require all resources before producing O2
- increased the dry weight of the recyclers
- changed manufacturer on all life support parts from "Jebediah's Fine Breathables" to "Ion Tech [Hot Air div]"
- moved electrical drain from the ModuleCommand to the IonModuleLifeSupport.  Drain will now shut off when no Kerbals are in the part.
- added default values for scrubber rate and electrical rate
- changed O2, CO2, and electrical rates to show as /h on the part interface.
